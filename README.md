The Health Ministry of the country in which the system is being created is the project's client. The population's safety and well-being are the Health Ministry's main priorities as the government department in charge of managing public health programs and healthcare services. They have an interest in putting into place efficient processes and strategies to manage and improve public health outcomes, such as illness prevention, access to care, and health education. The Ministry aims to use technology to improve data management, expedite operations, and boost communication between public health experts, healthcare providers, and the general public. Therefore, by offering complete tools for disease management, health inspection, tracking vaccinations, reproductive health monitoring, and student health, the proposed MOH system seeks to assist the goals of the Health Ministry.
